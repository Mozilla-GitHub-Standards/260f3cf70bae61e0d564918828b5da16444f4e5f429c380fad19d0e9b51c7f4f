Here you'll find hands-on tools and step by step instructions to make your Mozilla Club even more appealing!

## Step 1. Name and brand your club

You may, but are not required to, use the name “Mozilla Clubs” in your club’s name. Your use of “Mozilla Club” to refer to your Club must always be in combination with the location, region, group, or interest you are using to identify your club. (For clarity, you may nonetheless state that your club is “a Mozilla Club,” without the additional identifiers).

**Examples of names WITH Mozilla Clubs:** Mozilla Club Rio, Mozilla Club Jahangirnagar University, Cikarang Mozilla Club, Mozilla Club for the Chicago Librarians.
 
**Examples of names WITHOUT Mozilla Clubs:** Ikaros, Coders Paradise, Community Tech Club, Indigenous Code, Active Minds.

>**OKAY**
>- Join our Mozilla Club Rio! We are a Mozilla Club in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
>- This is the website for the Mozilla Club for the Chicago Librarians.
 
>**NOT OKAY**
>- Join Mozilla Clubs!
>- This is the website for Mozilla Rio.
>- Welcome to the Mozilla Rio Club.

### Create your own Logo!

We welcome you to use this template to create a logo or use [this](https://github.com/mozilla/mozillaclubs/blob/master/designresources/Mozilla%20Clubs%20Logo/logo_particular_club.svg) file that incorporates the “Mozilla Clubs” wordmark.  

<iframe width="760" height="305" src="https://thimbleprojects.org/carotejada/272301/"></iframe>

Standalone uses of the “Mozilla” and “Mozilla Clubs” wordmarks are limited to what is permitted under the Mozilla Trademark Policyand our brand principles. These guidelines do not give you additional permissions to use those or other Mozilla logos such as the Firefox logo.

### Color palette

Mozilla’s main brand colors are black and white. This illustrates our gutsy personality and provides a bold aesthetic to our brand. And our secondary palette is made up of 9 colors — 6 pastels and 3 neons. These colors are used interchangeably to provide contrast and brightness to our bold black and white main color scheme. See palette [here](https://mozilla.ninja/visualelements/).

### Thypography

Zilla is our core brand identity display typeface. We use it for our wordmark, for headlines and throughout our design. Zilla is an open source font and is available to [download](https://github.com/mozilla/zilla-slab/tree/master/OTF_release%20files).

## Step 2. Create your Media


### Building a website for your club

Some clubs have created their own websites to spread the word about what they do (See examples below). Club Captains are welcome to use any tool of their preference, however here are two templates ([Option A](https://edovio.github.io/WebsiteMozillaClub/) - [Option B](https://edovio.github.io/WebsiteMozillaClubB/)) built by community member Edoardo Viola. You are allowed to fork the project, remix it and share!

> Here you can find the Repo. IMPORTANT: before making any edits, make sure to follow instructions.

**Domain names.** You may use the name of your club, which may include the Mozilla name, in the domain name for any website you create for your club. For any other uses of the Mozilla name in your domain name, please file an [application for a license to use a domain name related to a Mozilla trademark](http://static.mozilla.com/foundation/documents/domain-name-license.pdf).
 
The front page of your website (above the fold) must inform users that “[CLUB NAME] is part of the network of Mozilla Clubs inspired by the [Mozilla Learning Network](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/).” At the top of the site’s main page, it should be stated clearly and explicitly that this is a community site, maintained by a group of volunteers.
