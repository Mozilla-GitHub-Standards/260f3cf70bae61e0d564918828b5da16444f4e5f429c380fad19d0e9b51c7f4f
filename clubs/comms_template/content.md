# Communications Guidelines and Templates 

*"First comes aesthetics, then logic".* That's what writer Daniel Tammet afirms, and that is the reason behind this tool. Here you'll find resources to shape your Club's image and make it appealing!

## 1. Name your club

You may, but are not required to, use the name “Mozilla Clubs” in your club’s name. 
 
Your use of “Mozilla Club” to refer to your Club must always be in combination with the location, region, group, or interest you are using to identify your club. (For clarity, you may nonetheless state that your club is “a Mozilla Club,” without the additional identifiers).

**Examples of names WITH Mozilla Clubs:** Mozilla Club Rio, Mozilla Club Jahangirnagar University, Cikarang Mozilla Club, Mozilla Club for the Chicago Librarians.
 
**Examples of names WOTHOUT Mozilla Clubs:** Ikaros, Coders Paradise, Community Tech Club, Indigenous Code, Active Minds.


## 2. What about a Logo?

We welcome you to use this template to create a logo or use this file that incorporates the “Mozilla Clubs” wordmark. Standalone uses of the “Mozilla” and “Mozilla Clubs” wordmarks are limited to what is permitted under the Mozilla Trademark Policyand our brand principles. These guidelines do not give you additional permissions to use those or other Mozilla logos such as the Firefox logo.

### Thypography

Zilla is our core brand identity display typeface. We use it for our wordmark, for headlines and throughout our design. Zilla is an open source font and is available to [download](https://github.com/mozilla/zilla-slab/tree/master/OTF_release%20files).

### Color palette

Mozilla’s main brand colors are black and white. This illustrates our gutsy personality and provides a bold aesthetic to our brand. And our secondary palette is made up of 9 colors — 6 pastels and 3 neons. These colors are used interchangeably to provide contrast and brightness to our bold black and white main color scheme.
