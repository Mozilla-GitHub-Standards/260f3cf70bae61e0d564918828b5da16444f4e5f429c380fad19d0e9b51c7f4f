## 1. Name your club

You may, but are not required to, use the name “Mozilla Clubs” in your club’s name. 
 
Your use of “Mozilla Club” to refer to your Club must always be in combination with the location, region, group, or interest you are using to identify your club. (For clarity, you may nonetheless state that your club is “a Mozilla Club,” without the additional identifiers).

**Examples of names WITH Mozilla Clubs:** Mozilla Club Rio, Mozilla Club Jahangirnagar University, Cikarang Mozilla Club, Mozilla Club for the Chicago Librarians.
 
**Examples of names WOTHOUT Mozilla Clubs:** Ikaros, Coders Paradise, Community Tech Club, Indigenous Code, Active Minds.


## 2. What about a Logo?

We welcome you to use this template to create a logo or use this file that incorporates the “Mozilla Clubs” wordmark. Standalone uses of the “Mozilla” and “Mozilla Clubs” wordmarks are limited to what is permitted under the Mozilla Trademark Policyand our brand principles. These guidelines do not give you additional permissions to use those or other Mozilla logos such as the Firefox logo.
